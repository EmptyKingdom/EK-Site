Simple widget to show the latest/random images of the WordPress media library as a Widget, using a shortcode or directly with a php-function.

== Description ==

Gallery Widget is a simple plugin that let you show the latest/random images of
the wordpress media gallery inside a widget, directly in your templates (it is
possible to choose some categories to be included/excluded) or in posts/pages
using a shortcode (see faq on how to use them).

For more information on how to use this plugin see [splash ;)](http://blog.splash.de/plugins/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'gallery_widget' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress admin
3. Go to Design->Widgets, activate the "Gallery Widget", adjust the title and max number of images to your needs
or
3. use the php-object `$galleryWidget` in your template (see [here](http://board.splash.de/showpost.php?p=173891&postcount=3) )

Warning: Cause of the way the attachments are fetched using the standard option (all), even images of not yet
published posts are shown. If this is a problem for you, you should use the option (include or exclude), although it
is less optimized.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can i adjust the look of the Widget? =

Just use the CSS-Class "wGallery" to alter the ul- or li-tags.

= How can i get only the images of one/some categories? =

Use the category-option include or exclude and enter the id's separated by comma
in the options of the widget.

This option actually only works with "category-option" set to include or exclude.
