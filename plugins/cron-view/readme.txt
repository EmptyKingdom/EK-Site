Requires at least: 2.7
Tested up to: 3.3.2
Stable tag: 1.03

Allows you to view all WP Cron events. Handy for development.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a page in the admin area where you can see all the queued Cron events, when they are due, which schedule they are on (or if they are one off) and which hook they will call. Future development might include:

* Removing Cron events
* Seeing which functions/methods are currently called by which hooks
* Manually adding Cron events
* Editing Cron events

However, do not hold your breath! Development for this plugin will be as and when I need it, or when someone submits a handy patch. I'm definitely open to co-development on this one, so if you want to join in then [contact me](http://www.simonwheatley.co.uk/contact-me/).

Any issues: [contact me](http://www.simonwheatley.co.uk/contact-me/).
